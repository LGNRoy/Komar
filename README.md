# Komar
It is a udacity-driving-car solution based on the model: komanda of fmjshiggins<br>
https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/blob/master/steering-models/community-models/komanda/solution-komanda.ipynb

# Problems
1. The two CSVs are not found, so i replace them with 2 CSV from udacity with the same structure.<br>
  1.1 The output CSV should come from the result of a script:<br>
    https://github.com/rwightman/udacity-driving-reader<br>
  1.2 the second CSV should come from the udacity, but it seems that it is deleated<br>
